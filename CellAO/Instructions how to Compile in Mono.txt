
Requirements:
- Mono 2.10 and MonoDevelop (tested with v2.8.6.5), other IDE's should work too
- a texteditor
- subversion client to download the source

Step 1: Changes

There are 3 files we have to copy and change to get it running (at least until i can come up with a better solution):
Move CellAO/AO.Servers/ZoneEngine/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs.template to CellAO/AO.Servers/ZoneEngine/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs
Move CellAO/AO.Servers/LoginEngine/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs.template to CellAO/AO.Servers/LoginEngine/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs
Move CellAO/AO.Servers/ChatEngine/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs.template to CellAO/AO.Servers/ChatEngine/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs

Now open the files in your favorite Editor and Search/Replace the following things:
[assembly: AssemblyDescription("Yalm$WCMODS? *modified*:$")] with [assembly: AssemblyDescription("Yalm")]
[assembly: AssemblyTrademark("$WCMIXED?1:0$;$WCMODS?1:0$")]  with [assembly: AssemblyTrademark("0;0")]
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.4.0.$WCREV$")]                 with [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.4.0.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.4.0.$WCREV$")]             with [assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.4.0.0")]

Do this for all 3 files and then open up MonoDevelop.
Open the CellAO.sln and change into the Libraries project folder.
Edit the Project options for NLog.netfx40, and change to Build->Compiler. Add the Symbol MONO_2_10. Do this twice for Release and Debug.

Step 2: Compile

Ignore the warnings and start ChatEngine, LoginEngine and ZoneEngine after you adjusted the Config.xml.

Thats it.

Suggestions how to add the revision number to the AssemblyInfo.cs again are very welcome.

Tested with Linux 2.6.32 Debian, Mono 2.10, MonoDevelop 2.8.6.5, CellAO rev 524
