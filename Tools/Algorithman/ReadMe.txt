Xyphos Plugin to create the items.sql and nanos.sql fast and easy.

How to use:
- put the FunctionSets.cfg into your xyphos config folder (create if not existant)
- put the AOCell-Plugin.dll into your xyphos plugin folder
- extract with original XMLOutput Plugin
- switch either to AOCellItemsOutput or AOCellNanosOutput and do a full parse
- put the items.sql/nanos.sql inside the SQLTables folder
- drop the items and/or nanos table manually with your preferred SQL Query tool
- start the Zoneengine and let the tables be recreated

Source will be released when im done with the beautifying :)
